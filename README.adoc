This is an optional stubs artifact providing the same API as `ghostwheel.core` and `ghostwheel.tracer` but not doing anything. It isn't required or even particularly recommended – the main link:https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel[Ghostwheel] module uses the exact same code for code-stripping in production – but it could be used to minimise the number of dependencies in a production build even further.

Inspired by https://github.com/philoskim/debux-stubs.
