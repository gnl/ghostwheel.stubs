This is a stub artifact for link:https://github.com/gnl/ghostwheel[Ghostwheel] providing the same API as `ghostwheel.core` and `ghostwheel.tracer` but not doing anything other than stripping inline gspecs. It is meant for use in production to minimise the number of dependencies and the bundle size in a more reliable manner than dead code elimination.

Inspired by https://github.com/philoskim/debux-stubs.
